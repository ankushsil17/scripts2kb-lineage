========================================
This version keeps all function names, but replaces private implementations with
step-by-step comments describing what happens inside. This makes it easy to
understand the logic without exposing private dataset rules.
"""

def parse_units(content):
    """
    Breaks down raw scheduler/script content into smaller blocks called "units".
    - Splits content into sections.
    - Extracts labels, comments, and metadata for each unit.
    - Returns a structured list/dict of unit objects.
    """


def normalize_paths(path_str):
    """
    Cleans and standardizes file/script paths.
    - Removes redundant slashes, quotes, or OS-specific junk.
    - Converts paths to a canonical form.
    - Ensures consistent format for matching later.
    """


def translate_labels(text, lang="auto"):
    """
    Translates or normalizes labels/comments into English.
    - Detects source language if needed.
    - Applies translation (human or model).
    - Returns normalized text for searchability.
    """


def generate_description(unit_row):
    """
    Generates a short human-readable summary for a unit/script.
    - Reads extracted fields (name, path, parameters).
    - Crafts a concise narrative (1–2 sentences).
    - Example: "This unit loads table X and transforms columns Y,Z."
    """


def validate_and_repair(df):
    """
    Validates the enriched DataFrame against required schema.
    - Checks for missing fields or invalid values.
    - Marks rows as 'Complete' or 'Incomplete'.
    - If possible, repairs values using fallback rules.
    - Returns cleaned DataFrame.
    """


def export_to_excel(df, filename="JP1_150_300_FINAL.xlsx"):
    """
    Writes the enriched DataFrame to Excel for downstream use.
    - Applies column ordering and headers.
    - Saves to given filename.
    - File is later consumed for KB + lineage building.
    """


def write_kb_sqlite(df, db_path):
    """
    Stores the DataFrame in a lightweight SQLite Knowledge Base.
    - Creates a table 'script_metadata'.
    - Adds indices for quick search on key columns.
    """


def build_lineage_graph(df):
    """
    Builds a directed graph of execution flow.
    - Adds nodes for each 'unit' and each 'script'.
    - Adds edges:
        unit → script  (if the unit executes a script)
        unit → unit    (if one unit depends on another via sequence number)
    - Returns a NetworkX graph.
    """


def export_graph(G, export_dir):
    """
    Exports the lineage graph to multiple formats.
    - GraphML (for Gephi / Cytoscape).
    - nodes.csv (all nodes with attributes).
    - edges.csv (all edges with relations).
    """


def main():
    """
    Pipeline driver:
    1. Run original pipeline (parse → enrich → Excel).
    2. If Excel already exists, load it.
    3. Call KB writer to save results in SQLite.
    4. Build lineage graph and export to GraphML + CSV.
